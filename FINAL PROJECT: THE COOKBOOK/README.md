### 2. Description: 
The Cookbook is a web application that allows users to explore and discover new recipes based on their culinary preferences, using a combination of advanced search and recommendation features powered by Flask, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, SQL, and the Spoonacular API. There are three features available on the website: search, recommendations, and history. The search feature can be accessed by anyone, but you will need to create an account to access the recommendations and history features. To search, click on the "Search" button in the navigation bar. A new screen will appear with a search bar. Simply enter a type of food, ingredients, or the name of a dish, and the website will provide you with a list of recipes and instructions for preparing the dish. To create an account, go to the top right corner of the page and click on the "register" button. Keep in mind that your username must be unique, and the website will check for this by checking the existing users in its database. Once you are logged in, make at least three searches to unlock the recommendation feature. Each time you view a recipe, it will be stored in the database and displayed in a table in the "history" section, which can also be accessed through the navigation bar. The recommendation feature will provide you with recommendations based on your previous searches and the recipes you have viewed. The API played a crucial role in the project, as it allowed us to retrieve data (in this case, recipes) and connect it to the frontend. We used Jinja to connect the recipes and other API-powered elements to the frontend, implementing for loops to display multiple results, if statements to handle cases where no results were returned, and more. Additionally, we utilized global variables and lists to ensure smooth operation of the app by allowing different functions (such as results and recipes) to be interconnected. When the user searches for different results, we use the .clear() function to reset the lists and make room for the new data. Overall, the API and these programming techniques were integral in bringing the project to life and providing a seamless user experience.

### 3. Challenges: 
One of the most challenging aspects of the project was working on the backend, particularly navigating the API documentation, integrating the API, and getting everything to function properly on my own system. I opted to use VSCode and develop the project outside of the CS50 codespace, which added an additional layer of complexity and took some time to get everything running smoothly. Overall, the backend proved to be a significant challenge, but ultimately rewarding as I gained valuable experience in these areas.

### 4. To CS50: 
The course was certainly challenging, but I found it extremely rewarding and beneficial to my understanding of computer science. The problem sets were particularly difficult, but it pushed me to think critically and creatively, and as a result, I feel more confident in my abilities as a programmer. I am grateful to David and the entire CS50 team for providing such an enriching and engaging learning experience. Thank you!
